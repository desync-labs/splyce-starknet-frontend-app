      Tradeflow USD is an investment grade Commodity finance fund that has had a
      successful track record since 2018. The TradeFlow funds currently manage
      around $130 million in assets. The TradeFlow funds focus on supporting
      Small Medium size firms in their import/export transactions of physical
      commodities e.g. non-perishable food crops, agricultural farming inputs,
      metals for recycling and some energy products. The fund invests in insured
      physical commodity transactions with a maximum duration of 90 days. This
      means it provides financing for the import and export of physical

      commodity funding strategy as a short-term, commodity-backed cash
